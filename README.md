# DS-Take-Home-Challenge

### 1. Conversion Rate
##### Goal:
Optimizing conversion rate is likely the most common work of a data scientist, and rightfully so. 
The goal of this challenge is to build a model that predicts conversion rate and, based on the model, come up with ideas to improve re]enue.
##### Challenge Description:
- Predict conversion rate.
- Come up with recommendations for the product team and the marketing team to improve conversion rate.


### 2. Spanish Translation A/B Test
##### Goal:
A/B tests play a huge role in website optimization. Furthermore, companies often run tens, if not hundreds, of A/B tests at the same time. Manually analyzing all of them would require lot of time and people. Therefore, it is common practice to look at the typical A/B test analysis steps and try to automate as much as possible. 
The goal of this challenge is to analyze results from an A/B test.
##### Challenge Description:
- Confirm that the test is actually negative. That is, it appears that the old version of the site with just one translation across Spain and LatAm performs better.
- Explain why that might be happening. Are the localized translations really worse?
- If you identified what was wrong, design an algorithm that would return FALSE if the same problem is happening in the future and TRUE if everything is good and the results can be trusted.


### 3. Employee Retention
##### Goal:
Employee turn-over is a very costly problem for companies. Understanding why and when employees are most likely to leave can lead to actions to improve employee retention as well as planning new hiring in advance. This application of DS is sometimes called people analytics or people data science.
The goal of this challenge to predict when employees are going to quit by understanding the main drivers of employee churn.
##### Challenge Description:
- Assume, for each company, that the headcount starts from zero on 2011/01/23. Estimate employee headcount, for each company, on each day, from 2011/01/24 to 2015/12/13.
That is, if by 2012/03/02 2000 people have joined company 1 and 1000 of them have already quit, then company headcount on 2012/03/02 for company 1 would be 1000. You should create a table with 3 columns: day, employee_headcount, company_id.
- What are the main factors that drive employee churn? Do they make sense? Explain your findings.
- If you could add to this data set just one variable that could help explain employee churn, what would that be?
